# LBL-thermodynamic-electrolyte-research
Performance of electrolytes in Li-ion batteries is characterized by thermodynamic properties such as the activity coefficients of salts and solvents, thermodynamic factor of salts and the osmotic coefficient of solvents. Often, experimental data found in literature are only available in one thermodynamic property. Fortunately, you can convert between these properties using mathematical equations.  This code contains 8 different functions that convert these thermodynamic properties to each other.
